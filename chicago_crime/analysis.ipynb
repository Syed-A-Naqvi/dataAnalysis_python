    "Often referred to in pop-culture as \"Chiraq\", a play on words referring to levels of violence experienced in the Second Persian Gulf War in Iraq; Chicago has some of the highest crime rates across the United States. Being that crimes can vary among a wide array of categories, it is likely that the occurence frequencies of certain crimes may be affected by parameters such as location or time of day. It is imperative to gain a better understanding of high risk locations and times of day so that civillians, law enforcement and goverments are able to make better decisions aimed at improving overall inhabitant safety.\n",

I wanted to determine what the relationships were between the types of crime, time of day and location. From the analyzed data and models we can see that theft and battery make up the majority of crime types. It also seems that the most at-risk locations for the common crime types are in the open; out on the street and on sidewalks as well as in higher conjested areas such as residential appartments. Finally, the times of day for the occurence of the top 10 most common crimes is in the pm times from about 12pm to 10pm. Being that one of the more common types of crimes were things such as theft and robbery, people would be safer if they travel light and avoid being alone in public between pm times."
